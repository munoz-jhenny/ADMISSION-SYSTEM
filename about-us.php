      <p>
        The Smart Local Government Unit (LGU) Admission System is a web-based platform developed to enhance the implementation of the TUPAD Program (Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers) in Sta. Rita, Pampanga.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
      <p>
       In response to the growing demand for fair and efficient public service, this system was created to assist LGU officials and program coordinators in accurately verifying applicants' identities and removing 
       duplicate entries from the TUPAD registry. Through this innovation, we seek to ensure that government aid reaches only the rightful and most deserving beneficiaries.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Our mission is to transform SANTA RITA into a progressive community propelled by socially enlightened leaders and empowered citizenry, spiritually committed to attain sustainable growth and optimum
        development; to increase the capability and improve the quality of life of every citizen as we promote a more positive, dynamic, and responsive governance leading to aggressive growth ushered by genuine
        public service geared towards a stronger economy and the capability building of Riteñans through the efficient and effective delivery of basic services, especially to the poor.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>
        Santa Rita, rising in holistic progress with a vibrant community where citizens are contented, healthy, skilled, and educated: that the Riteñans will have a sense of pride for their unique cultural 
        and religous heritage, their own products, their own talents, the Municipal Government, and the place itself; that the whole citizenry will be committed in achieving sustainable growth and development, 
        in the leadership of the LGU.
